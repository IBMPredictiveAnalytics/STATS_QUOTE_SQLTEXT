# STATS QUOTE SQLTEXT
## Quote SQL text appropriately for use in GET DATA
 This package takes as input a file of SQL text that was not generated by the Database Wizard and adds quotes as necessary for it to be used in the GET DATA command.  Wizard-generated text is already in this format, but SQL generated by an external tool or handwritten needs to be properly quoted before use.
